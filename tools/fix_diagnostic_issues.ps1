# ============================================================================
# HybridRAG -- Fix Diagnostic Issues (tools/fix_diagnostic_issues.ps1)
# ============================================================================
#
# WHAT THIS DOES:
#   Placeholder for a script that will auto-fix common diagnostic failures.
#   Currently empty -- fixes are applied manually based on diagnostic output.
#
# FUTURE INTENT:
#   When run, this would read the diagnostic report and attempt to fix
#   common problems automatically (missing packages, bad permissions,
#   stale config entries, etc.)
#
# STATUS: Not yet implemented. Use the diagnostic output and fix manually.
